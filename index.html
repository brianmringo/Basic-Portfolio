              Thank you for coming to my page! I can honestly say there is nothing stranger for me than writing about myself. I find it mostly difficult because the people I surround myself with are some of the most amazing and talented individuals to ever exist. And yet, I can hoenstly say, they are what make me great and amazing.

              I hope you find the contents of my website as exciting as I do. I have dedicated my professional career to making the world better for people who would otherwise not be able to afford that luxury. I truly believe that technology and easy access to information is key to creating a more equitable, fair, and ultimately good world. That is my portfolio in a nutshell. I hope you enjoy.
